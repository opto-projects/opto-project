Image Statistics Extension is a plug-in for [OCTproZ](https://github.com/spectralcode/OCTproZ). It displays a histogram of processed or raw OCT data during acquisition. A movable and resizable red rectangle in the preview window defines a region of interest. Zooming inside the preview window is possible with Ctrl + mouse wheel.
